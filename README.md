# Climbing_Performance_Myth_Tester

Hello! This repository current houses a single Excel file which will periodically be updated. The file includes information regarding indoor rock climbers' performances at varying gyms and at differing times. 

DATA COLLECTION IS ONGOING! If you would like to contribute your own data (which would be very much appreciated) feel free to reach out! If submitting data, please consult the Excel file included here to get an idea about the sorts of information I am interested in. Submissions formatted in way friendly to R, SQL, or Python (REQUEST: Please include the same column headers as those included in the Excel file. If they are different or absent, that is alright but I prefer they be included) are acceptable.

Once the data collection process has been completed, I will begin working on the following components:

1. Predictive algorithms for the efficiency (attempts to completions ratio) of a given climber.
2. An interactive dashboard that allows users to imput their own data (probably in the form of summary statistics) and have said dashboard return 
   information about how a user measures up to different climbers (e.g., comparisons to average, advanced, and [if possible] professional climbers).

These components will likely be modified as the project progresses and should not be taken as strict descriptions of the expected final product(s). 

I will probably use R for most of the project, with SQL, MATLAB, and Python being used to supplement R where it is either simpler or less
technologically intensive to do so.
