# Climbing_Performance_Myth_Tester

Hi! This is where I am currently storing data I am collecting on my rock climbing progression. At the moment, the data consists only of indoor climbing records but this will hopefully be expanded over the coming few months. I am also looking to combine my own climbing data with others' data, though I am currently working on how best to obtain said data (I'm mostly trying to make data submission more convenient at the moment).

The endgoal of this data collection to build out machine learning models for predicting the estimated time for a given climber to successfully climb a user-selected difficulty grade.

At the moment, I am storing the data in an Excel file since I expect the data to remain relatively small in size (no larger than a few thousand rows). If the project should become collaborative (which I hope to make it), I may swtich to using a database for ease of use in multiple locations.

In case you are wondering why I called this repository "Climbing_Performance_Myth_Tester", there are two reasons:

   1. I have heard a lot of newer climbers, especially in rock climbing gyms, express the (I believe) false sentiment that really skilled climbers fall less than beginner or intermediate climbers. Having no actual data with which to assess the truthfulness of said assertion and a surprisingly large amount of curiousity about the question, I started collecting data on my own climbing.
   2. In addition to this possible myth about climbing, I have encountered a rather large number of seemingly ubiquitous beliefs among climbers about climbing, including but not limited to:
  
      I. American climbing gyms overgrade and are usually easier than European gyms.
      
      II. A person's outdoor climbing max grade is usually two lower than their indoor max grade.
      
      III. Kilter board climbs are overgraded.
      
      IV. Bouldering is easier than lead climbing.
      
      V. Speed climbing is boring (not a measurable claim but one that I contest all the same).
      
      ...and my personal favorite.
      
      VI. Crimps are the hardest type of hold to deal with (in all fairness, I've heard the same said of every type of hold except jugs).
      
And that's a short(ish) summary of what this repository is for, why it's called what it is, and what I hope to do with it. Enjoy!

p.s. feel free to critique any of the components I put in this repository. I am always looking to improve my work.
