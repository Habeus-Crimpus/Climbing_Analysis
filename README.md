# Climbing Data Analysis

## TLDR

I am currently learning Python for data science and have been recording data about my own rock climbing over the past 12 months (as of May 2023). This data is being used so I can practice Python topics as I learn them. 

## Slightly Longer Version

It is the hope that this will eventually be expanded into a full system of acquiring data from many people (ideally, thousands) and move away from the CSV-dependent format it currently exists in. If a sufficiently large dataset can be acquired, meaning approximately 10,000,000 rows of data, I will work on developing a machine learning-driven system for predicting three metrics:

1. Number of attempts required to complete a given climb
2. Real grade capability (i.e. what grade are you really likely to complete within 1 or 2 attempts)
3. Time required to climb a given grade (this will probably be the metric of greatest interest)

This repository holds or will hold the following:

1. A CSV file containin data about my rock climbing history beginning in May 2022 up to the present.
2. (Not currently listed) A Jupyter notebook containing data visualization and analysis of the CSV data.
3. (Not currently listed) Python files containing relevant classes
4. (Not currently listed) A live file with links to a dashboard done with Microsoft Excel, Power BI, or Tableau (TBD)

To bolster data collection success, I will also (after the conclusion of the data science bootcamp that is currently eating up a solid 85% of my waking hours) shift way from manual collection and storage in a CSV. Instead, I will (hopefully) work jointly with a software engineer to utilize an API accessible through a webpage (or better yet, an app) to make data collection simpler & faster for climbers.
